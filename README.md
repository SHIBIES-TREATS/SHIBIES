   With our variable transaction fee, we want to avoid many large transactions for better decentralization. 
   We would like to attract so more small holders in order to become an even larger community. 
   Because the token supply is still high at the beginning, higher transaction fees will apply and early holders get more rewards. 
   The minimum fee will always be at least 1%.

   This is a full decentralized community token and we will burn the ownership after full distrubation.
   No sale or team tokens!
