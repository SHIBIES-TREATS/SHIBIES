   With our variable transaction fee, we want to avoid many large transactions for better decentralization. 
   We would like to attract so more small holders in order to become an even larger community. 
   Because the token supply is still high at the beginning, higher transaction fees will apply and early holders get more rewards. 
   The minimum fee will always be at least 1%.

   This is a full decentralized community project and we will change the ownership of each contract to our voting contract in near future.
   No sales ever!
