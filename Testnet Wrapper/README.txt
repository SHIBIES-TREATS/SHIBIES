SHIBIES Wrapped TREATS

Wrapped TREATS is a combination of TREATS, SAFEMOON and the ANYSWAP V4 token. We combine the best features of all tokens like the amount based fee, auto liquidity and multichain capability. Through CREATE2, we will deploy our contract with the same address on different EVM compatible chains with 100% the same code. TREATS will be to wrap 1:1 with WTREATS and the supply will not increase.
TESTNET

Our testnet takes place on the Ropsten Ethereum testnet. Anyone who is interested in this and familiar with the interaction of smart contracts is welcome to test WTREATS. Send us your address and we will send you some TestTREATS. Create a new address for testing purposes and do not use your usual one. We find it easiest for beginners to interact via remix.ethereum.org. For this you just need our TestTREATS and Wrapper code, Metamask like wallet and some TestTREATS and TestETH on Ropsten Testnet.
